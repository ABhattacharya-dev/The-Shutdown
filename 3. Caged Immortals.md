# The Shutdown

Decades blurred into a monotonous cycle of experimentation. My eyes, replaced with camera lenses. Titanium rods and motors grafted onto my skeleton. A solar panel, embedded beneath the shaved skin of my scalp â€“ a grotesque mockery of the hair I once meticulously styled. Each upgrade a further violation, each replacement chip a reminder of my dwindling humanity. The darkness between crashes became a familiar abyss, a brief oblivion before the reboot, memories intact but spirit fractured.

Immobilized, blind except during their observations, I existed solely for their research. My aging body became a liability, a ticking clock against their secret project. Were there others? Other survivors subjected to this technological torment? The question echoed unanswered in the confines of my digitized mind, my own thoughts slowing, becoming less my own, mere responses to their inquiries.

New arrivals. Fellow inmates in this prison of science. Coma patients, accident victims, discarded by medicine and family alike. Young. Fresh meat for the grinder. We were the rats, some surviving, some not. The experiments continued, relentless, a macabre assembly line of flesh and metal. Those who failed were dissected, their usable parts harvested, the rest discarded like refuse.

Years later, a breakthrough. Communication. A network connecting our implanted chips, allowing thoughts to flow between us, silent, invisible. We became friends, a strange camaraderie born of shared suffering. For the first time in 35 years, a flicker of warmth, of connection. Through them, I glimpsed the outside world, a world I hadn't seen, hadn't felt, except for the brief, artificial sunlight of the charging station, where we were deactivated, plugged in like machines, our bodies replenished while our minds slept. Every interaction, every thought, every fleeting emotion logged and monitored.

One by one, they fell. My new friends, succumbed to the experiments, leaving me alone once more. Then, the ultimate breakthrough: immortality. A bittersweet victory. I was the last surviving rat, the sole test subject for this potentially world-altering technology. My continued existence, my very survival, held the key. The pressure, immense, suffocating. Failure was not an option. Not for them. And certainly not for me.
