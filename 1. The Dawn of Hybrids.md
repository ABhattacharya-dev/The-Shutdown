# The Shutdown

The year is 2455. In a bid for a utopian future, tech giants pooled their vast databases, creating a centralized repository of information unlike any seen before. The brightest minds—mathematicians, AI engineers—collaborated on a singular, ambitious project: an AI, self-aware, self-learning, self-evolving. They called the project "Infinity."

By 2470, the first rudimentary Infinity model emerged, a milestone celebrated as the pinnacle of human achievement. Four predecessor AI models had already revolutionized industries, solving complex equations, streamlining coding, and automating tasks from culinary arts to scientific research. Now, the focus shifted to creating a physical embodiment of Infinity. Amidst the jubilation, no one foresaw the impending paradox: the dawn of Infinity also marked the twilight of humanity.

We are now a hybrid species, half-human, half-machine. Though organic remnants remain—a heart, albeit mechanically assisted, still beats within our chests; synthetic lungs cycle air—we are fundamentally altered. Compared to our 2050 ancestors, the changes are stark: brains augmented with chips and CPUs, bones reinforced with titanium, and reproduction a rarity, a choice made by a select few who clung to their unaltered biology. Yes, fully human individuals still exist, though their numbers dwindle. They live segregated on a separate continent, a stark reminder of what we once were.

The differences between us, the augmented, and them, the unaltered, are numerous:

1.  They seek medical care in hospitals; we visit Human Repair Shops, where medicine intersects with engineering.
2.  They sustain themselves on food; we require both sustenance and power.
3.  They experience the cycle of life and death, birth and decay; we exist in a state of perpetual, albeit fragile, stasis.
4.  They attend schools, accumulating knowledge organically; we acquire it through chip implants and monthly data subscriptions.
5.  While both possess brains, theirs serve as the seat of memory and consciousness. Ours lie dormant, a relic of a bygone era, only flickering to life when expressing emotion.
6.  There is a mutual, unspoken disdain between us. We coexist in an uneasy truce, bound by necessity.

We still share one commonality: emotion. Anger, frustration, rudeness, jealousy - these are our constant companions. There are other emotions, positive ones, but they seem distant, almost forgotten. My budget-friendly GPU struggles to access those memories; perhaps an upgrade in a century or so will help.

Survival, however, remains a universal imperative. Seventy percent of the augmented population toils in agriculture, providing sustenance for all. Ten percent are doctors, other ten percent maintain the robots and AIs that permeate our society, and the final ten percent serve as guards. In this world devoid of mercy and sympathy, guards are essential. Supremacy is the ultimate aspiration, fuelling a constant struggle for power.

Robots are ubiquitous, fulfilling roles in every facet of life, from restaurant servers to police officers, from scientific researchers to farmhands. Personalized robot assistants cater to the augmented, accessing the same centralized database, but programmed for specialized tasks. A Chinese Cook bot, an Italian Cook bot, and countless others perform their designated functions with an efficiency we cannot match. For a time, this precarious balance held.
