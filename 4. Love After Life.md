Content: Whispers have circulated for years, rumours of unethical experiments. Tonight, I can confirm: a hidden laboratory, funded by Government itself, is conducting horrific experiments on human subjects. They are... augmenting them, merging flesh with machine. I have seen it with my own eyes. They call it Project Immortality. This is not science; this is an abomination. The world needs to know!

We emerged from the shadow of the building. The moon. A silver disc in the velvet sky, a sight I hadn't seen since that fateful night, the night of the earthquake. Memories flooded back, overwhelming, the data surge pushing my processing power to its limit. Overheating. Just a moment before the crash...

A sudden coolness. A gentle touch on my cheek, a fleeting warmth as if someone had briefly embraced me. Then, nothing. Darkness. But in that moment of oblivion, a single, unwavering thought: it was her. My wife. A final, comforting illusion before the shutdown. A single tear traced a path down my cheek, a testament to a love that transcended death and technology.
